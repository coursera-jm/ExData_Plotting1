### Peer Assessments / Course Project 1
13-JUL-2014

  - Deliverables: four R scripts: plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R 
  - and the corresponding generated graphs: plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, plot4.png.  

All these files are located in the root of the repository:
https://github.com/coursera-jm/ExData_Plotting1

The dataset used for the project is downloaded and unzipped in the "data" folder. In the GitHub repository, this folder only contains the date when data were downloaded, corresponding to the graph generated, because of concerns with the files size. In order to regenerate the graphs, please clone the repository on a local machine (git clone) and then run each script separately. They will reload the dataset from the internet if it's not already present in the "data" sub-directory."
